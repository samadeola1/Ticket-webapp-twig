// assets/bootstrap.js
// If you have other initializations (e.g., for Bootstrap JS), keep them.
// Otherwise, this file might become very simple or even empty
// if app.js handles everything.

// Example: If you need to expose Stimulus globally (but you likely don't for this project)
// import { Application } from '@hotwired/stimulus';
// export const StimulusApp = Application.start();

// If you need NO specific bootstrap logic, ensure app.js is the entry point
// in webpack.config.js and this file might not be strictly needed by your code.
// However, Encore might still expect it to exist.
console.log("Bootstrap file loaded (Stimulus removed/commented).");
